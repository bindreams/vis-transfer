# Visual File Trasfer: Receive
Decode information stored in a recorded video file, generated by the the "send" module. After recording a video from "send" on your phone, run this program on your personal computer to get the file back.

Vis-transfer receiver is an C++ program. To compile, you will need:
- A C++23-capable compiler (such as [LLVM on Windows](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/latest) or a modern version of GCC on Linux);
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.25 or higher;
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Building
Open a terminal window in this folder (`recv` folder). Run the following commands to build the executable:
```sh
cmake --preset default  # Needs internet access
cmake --build build --config Release
cmake --install build --prefix dist --config Release 
```
The executable will be available in the `dist` folder. To decode a previously recorded video file, specify it as a command-line parameter, as well as the output file:
```sh
dist/vis-recv.exe recording.mp4 -o myfile.pdf
```

## Technical information
The project bundles a specific version of Vcpkg, which will be downloaded at CMake configure step. It manages the project dependencies:
- [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11), for command-line parsing;
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), for reading videofiles;
- [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp), for decoding QR codes;
- [LLFIO](https://github.com/ned14/llfio), for memory-mapped files;
- [CryptoPP](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp), for hashing;
- [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), for logging.
